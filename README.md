K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
Overview
K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) is a simple, non-parametric supervised machine learning algorithm used for classification and regression tasks. It predicts the label or value of a data point based on the majority class or average of its nearest neighbors in the feature space.

How It Works
Data Preparation: Normalize or scale the data to ensure all features contribute equally to the distance metric.
Choose Parameters: Select the number of neighbors, k, and the distance metric (e.g., Euclidean, Manhattan).
Prediction:
For classification: Assign the majority class among the k-nearest neighbors.
For regression: Compute the average value of the k-nearest neighbors.
Evaluation: Measure the model's performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, or mean squared error.
Key Features
Non-parametric: Makes no assumptions about the underlying data distribution.
Lazy Learning: Does not build a model during training; predictions are made directly from the dataset.
Distance-based: Relies on a distance metric to determine similarity between data points.
Applications
Image recognition
Recommender systems
Medical diagnosis
Stock market prediction
